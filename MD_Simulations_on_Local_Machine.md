# Standard Operating Procedure:  
## Running Molecular Dynamic Simulations on your Local Machine

### 1. Purpose
- This SOP outlines the steps necessary to run Molecular Dynamic Simulations using OpenMM and OpenFF on your local machine.

### 2. Procedure
#### 2.1 Downloading Necessary Software
##### 2.1.1 Install Visual Studio Code or any Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Follow the instructions to download VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
##### 2.1.2 Install Miniconda
- Follow the instructions to install Miniconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)
##### 2.1.3 Install Julia
- Follow the instructions to install Julia [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
##### 2.1.4 Install Packmol
- Follow the instructions to install Packmol [here](https://m3g.github.io/packmol/download.shtml)
##### 2.1.5 Install OpenMM
- Follow the instructions to install OpenMM [here](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application/01_getting_started.html#introduction)
##### 2.1.6 Install OpenFF
- Follow the instructions to install OpenFF [here](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/latest/installation.html)
##### 2.1.7 Install VMD
- Follow the instructions to install VMD [here](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD)

#### 2.2 Creating Folders for Files
- Create a folder for the whole project (ideally with no spaces in the title)
    -  Example: *GPE_Transport_Properties_for_SIBs*
    -  The name of folders and files should be detailed enough for one to immediately remember what they were working on 1 year in the future
- Within the project folder:
    -  Create a folder for initial PDB files of all molecules
    -  Create a folder for Packmol Input Files
    -  Create a folder for Packmol Output Files
    -  Create a folder for Molecular Dynamic Output Files

#### 2.3 Creating Initial Configurations with Packmol
- Form PDB files for molecules
    - Use PubChem to find SMILE string
        - Try Sigma Aldrich for specific chemicals found in papers
        - A short tutorial for the SMILES naming convention can be found [here](https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html)
        - If all else fails, one can use [this website](https://www.cheminfo.org/Chemistry/Cheminformatics/FormatConverter/index.html) to visualize how the molecule should look like and convert that image to a SMILES string or a PDB file
    - Use a SMILEs to PDB converter, download PDB file, and place in Initial PDB Folder
    - Small molecule SMILEs to PDB converter can be found [here](https://www.novoprolabs.com/tools/smiles2pdb)   
    - Polymer-sized molecule SMILEs to PDB converter can be found [here](https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/translate/)
- Open VS Code, open project folder, open Packmol Input Files folder
- Create a Packmol input file in the following format
    - Name the file in this format: *XXX.inp*
![Packmol Input File Example. This shows the spacing between molecules (tolerance), output file type, input file type, and the structure of the simulation box. The structure of the simulation box includes the initial molecule PDB file, how many atoms of each molecule should be in the box, the dimensions of the simulation box in Angstroms, and the end of the structure.](Packmol_input_file.png)
- Open Terminal/Command Prompt
```bash
    julia
```
```julia
    using Packmol
    input_file = "path_to_input_file/XXX.inp"
    run_packmol(input_file)
```
- Visualize the initial configuration box (the output PDB file from Packmol) using VMD 
- Within a text editor or IDE, open the initial configuration PDB file and write in the crystal structure of the simulation box at the top of the file after the last *REMARK* line and before the first *HETATM* line
    - eg. 40 Angstoms on each side and 90Â° Angles for a simulation box would be formatted as	*CRYST1   40.000   40.000   40.000  90.00  90.00  90.00 P 1           1*

#### 2.4 Performing Molecular Dynamic Simulations
- Using a text editor or IDE, write a script for the specific molecular dynamic simulation using Sage 2.2.0
    - An example of the script using OpenMM and OpenFF for the simulation can be found at [this website](https://docs.openforcefield.org/en/latest/examples/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/SMIRNOFF_simulation/run_simulation.html)
    - Name the script in the following format: *XXX.py*
    - Place script in the overall project folder
- Open Terminal/Command Prompt
    - Activate the micromamba environment used to install OpenMM and OpenFF
    - Navigate into the overall project folder
```bash
python XXX.py
```
